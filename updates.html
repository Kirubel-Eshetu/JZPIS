    </h1>
    <h2 style="font-size: 45px;">Here are the latest updates</h2>
    <p class="update">* Our facility (Jimma Prison Administration) has launched a new prisoner information system. It is
        accessed through a website. The developed system shows the facility's eagerness to modernize and automate how
        a prisoner information is stored and accessed.
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-size: 35px;">Parole</h3>
    <p class="update">Parole is a system of releasing prisoners before they have served their full sentences. When an
        individual is
        granted parole, they are allowed to serve the remainder of their sentence outside of prison, under certain
        conditions and supervision. These conditions often include regular meetings with a parole(Descipline) officer,
        adhering to a
        set of rules, maintaining employment or participating in rehabilitation programs, and refraining from criminal
        behavior.
        The primary goals of parole are to facilitate the reintegration of offenders into society, reduce prison
        overcrowding, and provide opportunities for rehabilitation and supervision. Parole decisions are typically made
        by a parole board or a similar authority based on factors such as the nature of the offense, the individual's
        behavior and progress while incarcerated, and the likelihood of successful reintegration into the community.</p>
    <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">Parole Points</h3>
    <p class="update">Parole points are a system used to assess the eligibility of prisoners for parole. These points
        are typically awarded based on various factors such as the severity of the crime, the behavior of the prisoner
        while incarcerated, participation in rehabilitation programs, and other relevant criteria.
        Prisoners accumulate or lose points based on their actions and behavior during their time in prison. These
        points can influence parole decisions, with prisoners who have accrued a sufficient number of points being
        considered for parole earlier than those with fewer points. The specific criteria and point system can vary
        depending on the jurisdiction and the policies of the parole board or governing authority.
        Parole points serve as a tool to evaluate the readiness of prisoners for reintegration into society and to
        assess the level of risk they may pose if released on parole. They help parole boards make informed decisions
        about whether an individual should be released early from prison and under what conditions.</p>
    <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Parole points in Jimma Zone Prison Administration</h3>
    <p class="update">In Jimma Zone Prison Administration, we give a well deserved attention to parole points. <br>At
        our facility, parole
        points
        are collected for a prisoner based on the behaviour improvements they show. Inmates are pursued by Descipline
        officers and the points are also updated by Descipline officers. If a prisoners has accumulated a total of 500
        points, after 7 days of further examination, they are given a year
        of mercy after the parole boards agree. <br> After relese due to mercy years, these inmates are followed further
        and
        if they live by the examining standards, they will be released from prison permanently.
        The prisoner should serve atleast 65% of their sentence years before being a mercy release.
