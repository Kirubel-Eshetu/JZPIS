# JZPIS
💻 This system was developed for Final Year Project defense in Jimma University on 2024

The developed system is called Jimma Zone Prisoner Information system (JZPIS). The system 
is implemented through a website. The website serves a range of functionalities including:

➢ Providing information about Jimma Zone Prison Administration.

➢ Serves rules and guidelines for visitors.

➢ Gives ways people can contact prison personnel.

➢ Presenting the contents in three languages. Amharic, English and Oromo.

➢ Adding extra layer of security for logging into user accounts with OTP.

➢ Managing user accounts.

➢ Creating backups.

➢ Visualizing comments and suggestions given.

➢ Storing Prisoner information securely through a database system.

➢ Storing visitor information efficiently.

➢ Parole point evaluation for individual inmate.

➢ Report and certificate preparation.

➢ Integrated face-detection and matching system.

➢ Management of prison cell.

📕 Since the system was developed for a final year project defense, a detailed documentation was also made. The documentation of the project was presented in two phases: 

-> System Design and
-> Implementaiton. 

📑 The documentation is the manual that can help you to understand and use the system. Since the system is open source, you can see the system's blueprint through this documentation. 

5️⃣ The documentation contains the following chapters:

-> Introduction to the proposal of the system

-> Requirement Analysis and Specification

-> System Design

-> Implementation and Testing 

-> Conclusions and Recommendations
